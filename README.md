## Requirements
To run the notebooks, the following packages are needed:
  * numpy
  * scipy
  * json
  * matplotlib
  * pandas
  
## Contained notebooks
* data_analysis.ipynb
  * analysis raw output data of ion_detect_mcmc package and gathers overall statistics
* BaesianEstPlots.ipynb:
  * plots the gained statistics for figures which can be found in the paper mentioned
